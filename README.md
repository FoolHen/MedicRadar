# VEXT-MedicRadar
Mod for Battlefield 3 [Venice Unleashed](https://veniceunleashed.net/) made with VeniceExtensions. Shows nearby medics with defib while waiting for revive.
### Set-up

You can get the latest release on [Releses](https://github.com/FoolHen/MedicRadar/releases).
Consider increasing the time a player can be revivable with the RCON command ``vars.playerManDownTime`` (percentage). The default is 100 (100%) which is around 13 seconds, and it should be increased for this mod to make sense. Players should have enough time to decide if its worth waiting for a medic or spawning again, and 13 seconds is not enough. Instead I recommend setting it to a minute (``vars.playerManDownTime 460``). Place this command on your ``Startup.txt`` file in your ``Server/Admin`` folder.
